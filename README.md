# Simple-Java-LAN-client

This is a simple program that I made to learn basic networking in java. It's a lan messenger in java that uses the java prompt
to send and receive messages.

## Instructions

Import the .java files into a java IDE, and run them from there. The program takes inputs using the scanner class, and 
outputs using System.out.print. First, run the main function on the server. It will output an ip, which you then type into
any client that wants to connect. After that, any message that the client types in will be sent to the server, and the server
will be able to use commands. 

## Prerequisites

Any java ide
